Broward.org uses the recently-released expansive library of FontAwesome 5 icons which has been built with the latest web standards to enhance user experience. For more information on FontAwesome, visit fontawesome.io.

A custom library of SVG icons has also been made for use specifically in the Quick Links section to visually assist the recognition of linked cards. Additional icons can be created if existing icons do not properly represent a link. To have a custom icon created, submit a work order request to OPC.

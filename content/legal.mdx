# Copyright

Do not use copyrighted information or images from other sources without permission to reuse the materials on the Broward County internet or intranet websites. Regardless of the source material, i.e. websites, compact discs (CD), books, photographs, etc., written permission may be required if the source material does not list rights to reuse.

The U.S. Copyright Act is found in Title 17 of the U.S. Code and contains the federal statutes governing copyright law in the United States. The Act protects the rights of copyright owners from reproducing (or copying) a work, distributing a work, or publicly displaying a work by others.

One of the reasons that the Web has been so successful is the ability to use graphics to convey information to users. Here are some key points that should be considered when selecting images for incorporation into a Web page.

- Use images created internally from a drawing or image creation program. It is best to create the image from your perspective. Remember, if you alter an existing drawing or image it may violate the copyright of the original work.
- Do not use an image from a commercial website unless licensed to use the image. These images should not be considered “fair use” or “free to use.”
- Certain images, such as Microsoft’s “internet Explorer” logo, may be used if the user accepts the terms of a license defining the permissible uses of the image. Usually, the user is not allowed to alter the appearance of the image, in any way.
- Use of licensed images, including clip-art, on a website does not violate copyright law. The purchaser of the licensed software has the right to use the image. Be aware that the license may not allow the user to alter the image. Always read the license agreement terms that is included with the software.

Original text, created or written for the development of a website is acceptable without any copyright concerns. Do not use someone else’s text on a website without getting permission from the creator.

Similar to images and text, do not copy scripting or programming from someone else without permission. There may be websites that allow someone to copy the scripting or programming. Be sure that any requirements identified in the website are followed by the programmer.

To summarize, do not use copyrighted information or images from other sources without permission to reuse the materials on the Broward County internet or intranet websites. Regardless of the source material, i.e. websites, Compact Discs (CD), books, photographs, etc., written permission may be required if the source material does not list rights to reuse.

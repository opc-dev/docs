The Broward County website Policy and Standards were created by the Office of Public Communications (OPC) in order to provide County agencies with policy and production
standards for the Broward County internet website and for the BrowardEmployee.org intranet website.

First launched in December 1995, the County’s website is comprised of thousands of “static” web pages representing approximately 70 County agencies. In addition, there are numerous interactive web applications that visitors to the site can use to conduct business with the County.

OPC is responsible for establishing policy, content development, information management, design services, and quality assurance for the County’s internet and intranet websites.

Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) is responsible for programming interactive applications, including those required for transactions, and for the management of the infrastructure (servers and communication lines).

The County’s internet website address is Broward.org and the County’s intranet website address is BrowardEmployee.org. All County agencies must coordinate their website and linkage to any web application(s) activities, including the purchase of additional domain names, through OPC.
The policies and standards contained in this document apply to both the internet and intranet websites and include internally and externally developed applications made available to site visitors.

The purpose of this site is to provide policy and standards for the Broward County Public internet site, Broward.org, and, when applicable, the Broward County employee intranet site, BrowardEmployee.org as well as useful information about the Broward County website.

These standards apply to all County agencies unless an exception has been approved by OPC. For purposes of these policies and standards, a “ County agency” refers to any County agency under the Broward County Board of County Commissioners including advisory boards and committees. The term “County agency website” refers to an internet or intranet website operated by or for a County agency, including those websites operated on behalf of a County agency by other public or private entities.

The Broward County Website policies and standards build upon the following standards:

- Website usability principles and techniques set forth by the Federal Web Managers Council, of the Interagency Committee on Government Information (ICGI), as one of
  the recommended best practices. Usability Best Practices helps ensure a Website meets users’ needs.
- Website standards for accessible design set forth by the U.S. Department of Justice under the Title II Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The Website Accessibility Best
  Practices under Title II of the ADA apply to state and local government websites.
- Web content accessibility guidelines as provided by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines explain how to make web content accessible to people with disabilities.

If a table is too wide, it should condense down and/or scroll horizontally.

Code snippets like `var foo = "bar";` can be shown inline.

Also, `this should vertically align` ~~`with this`~~ ~~and this~~.

Code can also be shown in a block element.

```
var foo = "bar";
```

Code can also use syntax highlighting.

```javascript
var foo = 'bar'
```

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```javascript
var foo =
  'The same thing is true for code with syntax highlighting. A single line of code should horizontally scroll if it is really long.'
```

```jsx live
<div>Live example</div>
```

Inline code inside table cells should still be distinguishable.

| Language   | Code               |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| Javascript | `var foo = "bar";` |
| Ruby       | `foo = "bar"`      |

Small images should be shown at their actual size.

![](http://placekitten.com/g/300/200/)

Large images should always scale down and fit in the content container.

![](http://placekitten.com/g/1200/800/)

```
This is the final element on the page and there should be no margin below this.

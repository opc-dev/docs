Broward County is committed to making our website(s) usable to the widest possible audience
to ensure easy access to County information and services for all, including people with disabilities.

As a County, we utilize the internet to offer the public information about County government, programs and activities. We also offer convenient access to public record searches, ePay, eRegistration a wide variety of other County services. The Broward County website is accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

The County also offers BrowardEmployee.org as an enterprise intranet site to County agencies and employees. Agencies are encouraged to maintain a BrowardEmployee.org site when they have employee specific information or resources to share.

OPC and ETS have developed policy and standards for the construction of the web content and online services available to the public and to County employees. These standards help ensure usability and accessibility.

As defined by Usability.gov, usability “measures the quality of a user’s experience when interacting with a product or system—whether a website, a software application, mobile technology, or any user-operated device.”

Visits to government websites have grown steadily and will continue to grow in the future. As of early 2018, over 55% of visitors access Broward.org via mobile devices and this percentage is increasing.

Through a consistent application of the County’s branded look and feel, information architecture and interactive experiences, with a mobile-first focus, including on agency sites, content creation and presentation as well as a consistent approach to software applications, we hope to ensure a high quality user experience. This is accomplished through use of a standardized master page, page layout templates and style options when editing content, as well as comprehensive training and guidelines. There is also a quality assurance process for the creation, review, and approval of content.

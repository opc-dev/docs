# File Naming

All internet file name conventions for documents, images and web pages should meet the following criteria:

- Use a n ame that represents the content of the document. For example, a 20 12 Annual Report document can be named AnnualReport2012.xxx.
- Capitalize the first letter of each word in the file name.
- Limit the length of the name to 15 characters whenever possible.
- Do not include special characters, spaces, hyphens, dashes, commas, periods, underlines, etc. This includes, but is not limited to the following file formats: .asp(x), .doc(x), .gif, .htm(l),
  .jp(e)g, .wmv, .pdf, .png, .ppt(x), .svg, .vsd, .vdx, and .xls(x).
- Complete the document properties for all Microsoft Office and Adobe documents. At a minimum, enter the Title, Author and Language (English). The language property is critical to web accessibility. The Author defaults to Active Directory User Name which should be changed to Broward County, followed by the Agency Name.
  Files should be optimized to improve site performance:
- Keep file sizes to a minimum. Although many users now have high speed internet connections, websites should be designed for viewers with slower connection speeds.
- Optimize files. Maximum file size should be kept below 200 KB. If this is not possible, consider breaking the document into smaller documents.

# Multimedia Files

## Audio Files

Audio recordings may be posted to the website with a text file of the audio content. All audio recordings submitted for placement on the website must be in one of the following formats:

- .avi
- .mp3
  All audio recordings must be the original or master source product (not a lower generation source copy and must have the industry standard Unity 0 db.

## Video Files

All video recordings for the website must be reviewed and approved by OPC before posting to the website. OPC, with the assistance of ETS, will be responsible for publishing the video recording. To encourage the broadest viewership, OPC will publish the appropriate agency videos to BrowardNOW and provide a link from the agency site(s) to BrowardNOW. If requested by the agency, OPC will publish the video on an agency page to open in a separate video player not associated with BrowardNOW. In addition, you must ensure all audio and video files meet Broward County accessibility standards.
All video recordings submitted for placement on the website must be in the following format:

- .mp4
- .mov
  All video recordings must be the original or master source product and not a lower generation source copy. All videos must use the NTSC standard, 4X3 aspect ratio or 16x9 ratio (widescreen).

### BrowardNOW

Broward County BrowardNOW offers video programming of interest to Broward County residents, businesses and visitors. Viewers can view the streaming media program playing on
Today’s Program schedule, or select another program from the On Demand library. Today’s Program schedule may be pre-empted by live streaming media broadcast of government
meetings. For a s chedule of these meetings, consult the Upcoming Government Webcasts which appears below the video player in the illustration below.

## Presentation Files

OPC recommends the use of standard Microsoft PowerPoint presentation templates that are branded with the Broward County look and feel. The templates, available in both 2010/2016 formats, can be downloaded from BrowardEmployee.org Forms under the heading of “Public Communications.” In order to make PowerPoint presentations easily visible to the web viewer, especially during a live Webcast (County Commission Meeting, Commission Workshop, etc), presentations should be created using:

- 30-32 font size
- No white background
- Charts or graphics should be kept simple and easy to read

# File Retention

Only relevant current files should be available on the County website. The County’s Web server must not be used as an archive repository for documents or image files of any format. In addition, the website cannot be used as an electronic archive of past files through links unless there is a good business reason. When you remove a link to a file on a County’s Web page, the file must first be removed from the County’s Web server. Please ensure broken links to the file do not occur after a file is deleted by performing a search for the file with the Broward County search. This includes document and image files that are no longer in use.

OPC and ETS have implemented Broward Web Publishing (BWP) for the Broward County internet website and for the BrowardEmployee.org intranet website. BWP allows authorized
individuals in each County agency the ability to manage the content of the agency’s Web pages.

The Broward County internet website is currently supported by Microsoft Sharepoint software. The Web environment architecture consists of a Windows server where Sharepoint operates. Content data, authored in Sharepoint, is stored on a Windows SQL server.

Workflow is used to review and approve the content for deployment to production. Once the content is approved, Content Deployment automatically publishes the necessary ASPX files to the Sharepoint server where they are housed and served to website visitors.

Sharepoint 2010 functionality includes:

- Broward Web Publishing (BWP)
- Document Management
- Portal Technology
- Search
- Collaborative Workspaces
- Business Intelligence
- Security
- Forms-driven Business Process
- Information Targeting

# Roles

BWP identifies three types of users: members, approvers and administrators.

## Members

Has contribute permissions to create, edit, and delete content, including sub sites, pages, images/graphics, and documents. Submits agency site changes to Agency Approver(s).

## Approvers

Has approval and publishing rights. Reviews content submitted by Member to ensure quality and compliance with the Broward County website Policy and Standards. Approves or rejects content submitted by Member. If Approver approves content, BWP services publishes the content for public viewing.

## Administrators

Creates subsites, manages user permissions, and manages overall site structure. Has contribute permissions to create, edit, and delete site content, including subsites, pages, images/graphics, and documents. Submits agency site changes to Agency Approver(s). Has approval and publishing rights. Reviews all contents for their sites and pages submitted by the site Member. If Approver approves content, BWP publishes the content for public viewing.

**Note:**

1. The approver is directly responsible for the quality assurance of the content before the content is published to the website. This includes adherence to the standards listed in this document.
2. OPC will periodically review agency Web pages to ensure quality control for both content and functionality. Non-compliance to the standards will be reported to the
   agency with a timeline for resolution by the agency.
3. The Office of Public Communications (OPC) will, in most instances, act as the administrator. These administrative tasks will be assigned to specific OPC staff.

To request agency access to Broward Web Publishing, go to BrowardEmployee.org Forms and select “Broward Web Publishing User Access” under the heading of “Public Communications.”

Access requires Broward Web Publishing training.

# Security

You must be an authorized user in order to work in Broward Web Publishing. This means that you are only permitted to work under your own active directory account, not anyone else’s. Due to security reasons do not use anyone else’s account. Users must not share their password with anyone else or provide access to the County network resources to unauthorized individuals.

# Training

Broward Web Publishing training is offered regularly throughout the calendar year. Upcoming classes are announced in Sun E-news or by email. Classes are filled on a first-come, first-served basis.

# Best Practices

Do not create unnecessary additional folders/sub-folders within your agency site inside Broward Web Publishing. Only the three folders listed below are allowed in the agency folder:

- Documents
- Images
- Pages

Create a draft of web page content. This draft can be shared with anyone designated to review the page prior to publishing the page.

Only publish a page when it is ready for viewing by the public.

Do not use BWP to archive old files. Publishers should remove all files that are no longer being
used. The agency is responsible for storing their files locally.

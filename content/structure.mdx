# Domain Names

A domain name is a unique name that identifies a website (such as www.Broward.org and Broward.org).

All domain name requests must come through OPC which will then coordinate the implementation of the domain name with ETS. ETS will purchase the domain name on the behalf
of the agency and maintain the renewal of such domain names for the time period determined by the agency.

When a domain name owned by an outside consultant/vendor is up for renewal, it is required that the agency must transfer the ownership from the consultant/vendor to Broward County.

## Subdomains

Subdomains divide up a web domain. A subdomain is prefixed to the primary domain name such as 911.Broward.org. It is different than a subsite (or “subdirectory”) in that the subsite name would be Broward.org/911. All subdomain requests must be approved and managed by OPC.

## Redirects

A redirect is a technique used to forward a website/page visitor to another URL location and are not used on Broward.org. Subdomains are the preferred alternative to this method.

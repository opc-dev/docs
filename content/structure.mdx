# Browser Compatibility

Broward.org is best viewed with the following minimum browser requirements:

- Microsoft® internet Explorer® 10.0+, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera or Safari
- JavaScript enabled
- A display resolution of 1024x768 (or higher) for video
- A Broadband connection for video
- Windows-compatible sound card for audio and video

# Domain Names

A domain name is a unique name that identifies a website (such as www.Broward.org and Broward.org).

All domain name requests must come through OPC which will then coordinate the implementation of the domain name with ETS. ETS will purchase the domain name on the behalf
of the agency and maintain the renewal of such domain names for the time period determined by the agency.

When a domain name owned by an outside consultant/vendor is up for renewal, it is required that the agency must transfer the ownership from the consultant/vendor to Broward County.

## Subdomains

Subdomains divide up a web domain. A subdomain is prefixed to the primary domain name such as 911.Broward.org. It is different than a subsite (or “subdirectory”) in that the subsite name would be Broward.org/911. All subdomain requests must be approved and managed by OPC.

## Redirects

A redirect is a technique used to forward a website/page visitor to another URL location and are not used on Broward.org. Subdomains are the preferred alternative to this method.

# Styles

## Logos

The Broward.org logo has been optimized for usage on the redesigned website as a scalable vector graphic (SVG) for a reduced file size and high-fidelity graphics.

## Typography

### Optimal readability

The majority of content on Broward.org is text-based therefore, using a typeface that works well for quick & easy reading on all devices is key to an improved website experience. The new Broward.org website uses the recently released ATC Arquette font family designed by Avondale Type Company. It has 8 weights and matching italics. It is a bold but neutral sans-serif designed for ease of legibility across all screen display sizes. For more information on ATC Arquette, visit avondaletypeco.com/fonts.

### A typographic system

A complete system of typographic styles based on web standards for readability & properlystructured HTML syntax has been implemented in this redesign. Selecting these styles is as simple as selecting a choice from a dropdown in Sharepoint.

## Icons

Broward.org uses the recently-released expansive library of FontAwesome 5 icons which has been built with the latest web standards to enhance user experience. For more information on FontAwesome, visit fontawesome.io.

A custom library of SVG icons has also been made for use specifically in the Quick Links section to visually assist the recognition of linked cards. Additional icons can be created if existing icons do not properly represent a link. To have a custom icon created, submit a work order request to OPC.

## Color

### Refined web color palette

Colors are a mainstay of the Broward County brand. In this update, the brand colors have been refined for the web with an understated boldness and contrast that meets or exceeds accessibility guidelines while maintaining delightful visual harmony. These colors are the only approved colors for use on Broward.org master pages & page layouts.

### Readable for type for as many users as possible

All potential color combinations of the refined color palette have been tested against Web A11Y Accessibility Standards. They have also been usability-tested with users who suffer from deutranopia, protanopia & tritanopia. These standards must be adhered to out of consideration for users with vision impairments. For more information on web accessibility, visit w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility.

## Components

Broward.org is based on Google’s Material Design which is an open source component-based “system for uniting style, branding, interaction, and motion under a consistent set of principles.”

Our site is built from a system of custom reusable modular components. All components have been carefully built using Broward brand styles & patterns of interaction that adhere to best practices for the modern web with a f ocus on mobile devices. For more information on Google Material Design, visit material.io.

## Responsive Grid Layout

The layout for Broward.org has been created using the Bootstrap framework. Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework in the world for building responsive, mobile-first projects on the web. Bootstrap 4 is the latest release of this framework and many of the latest developments in this project have been incorporated into Broward.org to deliver cutting-edge user experience while accomodating for all the various devices and browsers at use.

Broward.org is based on Bootstrap’s responsive 12-column grid for elements within a container of 1200 pixel max-width. Elements can also extend horizontally from edge-to-edge on the screen if necessary. Upon resizing of a browser window or viewing a page on a device of different screen size, the site dynamically adapts to deliver the best viewing experience for that particular screen. For more information on Bootstrap, visit getbootstrap.com.

# Master Page

The current version of Broward.org is built upon the Microsoft Sharepoint 2010 framework. Within this framework it is necessary that every page be assigned both a unique “master page” & “page layout.” In this redesign, we have reduced the number of master pages from over 800 existing in the previous version of the site down to one. This one master page contains header and footer elements. The header element contains navigation, search & accessibility options. The footer contains links to social media, comments and suggestions & terms of use. The master page can only be edited by OPC.

## Header

The header element spans across the top of each page. When scrolling through pages it remains ever-present, “stuck” to the top of the screen for easy access. Immediately visible on the header are the global navigation menu icon, Broward.org logo, search icon & accessibility icon. Each of these elements can be selected to reveal additional intuitive functionality.

### Navigation

Upon selecting the navigation menu (commonly referred to as a “hamburger” icon), a drawer slides in from the left. In this drawer, County-wide navigation is displayed. These links remain the same throughout all Broward.org sites providiing links to the top-level sites.

### Search

Upon selecting the search icon, a search bar drops down in which users can enter their search query. The Broward County public-facing website uses its own search appliance which is indexed nightly.

The best way to improve search results is to properly structure a site’s navigation and structure text content within each page following appropriate HTML syntax guidelines for hierarchy and accessibility. In addition to improving search results, this approach will ensure an improved experience for your users.

#### Search (Broward County Employee intranet websites)

The Broward County Employee intranet websites search engine, including “BrowardEmployee.org” and “BCPortal,” is provided by Microsoft Sharepoint. The search interface searches across all BrowardEmployee.org and BCPortal site collections. The search results can be managed by the site Administrator to ensure search results can be managed for audiences within an agency or across agencies.

### Accessibility Options

Upon selecting the accessibility options icon, three accessibility options will appear: increase text size, add contrast and translate.

By selecting to increase the text size (+A) , all text will be enlarged for easier readability. After selecting the increase text size (+A) option, the option will be changed to reduce text size (-A). Selecting the reduce text size (-A) option will result in reverting to the original setting.

By selecting the “add contrast” option, text will be made white and the background will become black. After selecting the “add contrast” option, the option will change to “remove contrast.” Selecting the option to “remove contrast” will result in reverting to the original setting. By selecting the “translate”, a dropdown with language options (Spanish, French, Creole & Portuguese) will appear and when a language is selected, text on the page will be dynamically translated to that language.

## Footer

The footer element spans the bottom of every Broward.org web page. It contains links to social
media, comments and suggestions & terms of use.

### Comments, Suggestions and Surveys

Currently, Broward County’s website provides a link to Comments and Suggestions on the home
page. This is a general customer feedback form and should not be confused with the standard
Customer Service survey required as part of the budget performance measure process.

Note:
An agency interested in an online Customer Satisfaction survey should contact OPC for
assistance in survey options and should not request an online survey through ETS.

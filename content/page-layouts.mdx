title: Page Layouts
---

There are six page layouts to choose from on the redesigned Broward.org website. They define the structure of the page elements between the header and footer which are inherited on every page from the master page. Every page must have a page layout assigned to it.

Some page layout elements are shared by all page layouts while others are included with specific layouts (layout-specific elements). Empty/unused elements, unless otherwise noted, will be automatically hidden when the page is published.

Page layouts can be easily changed when editing a page in Sharepoint.

## Shared Page Layout Elements

### Contact Us & Social Media Buttons

On all page layouts, there is a button labeled “Contact Us” that dynamically pulls contact information for each page from one centralized master contact list. When this button is selected, a modal appears that contains relevant contact information. The master contact list is maintained by OPC. To modify the information on a particular site or page, contact OPC.

In addition to the “Contact Us” button, there are optional social media buttons (Facebook, Twitter & YouTube) that also pull from the master contact list. These buttons link to relevant social media accounts. For more information on using social media for your site or page, refer to the section on social media in this document.

### Editable Content Areas

Every page layout contains editable content areas where text & images can be edited in BrowardAuthor. Inside the editable content area, users can insert text - including the option to insert tables & accordions (hide & shows) - and images.

#### Text

Text inside editable content areas can be structured according to an appropriate hierarchy using text styles available in the Sharepoint editing ribbon. Once applied, these styles will enable search engines to index the content and for readers to more easily scan content when reading.

Text styles available for use include:

- Headings (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5)
- Paragraph (default)
- Caption
- Blockquotes (blue & yellow)
- Horizontal rule
- Unordered list
- Ordered list

#### Tables

Tables have been optimized for viewing on mobile devices. Cells & columns resize to fit the size in use. By default, there is scroll functionality enabled for tables that extend beyond the width of 1200 pixels. They also have a refined modern look that allows for optimal reading. Two flavors of table are available: one with & one without vertical lines to designate columns.

#### Accordions (Hide & Shows)

Accordions have been simplified for easier reading and intuitive usage. These modules pull data dynamically from a list. The circle icon to the right of each closed item contains a ‘+’ which upon clicking rotates to become an ‘x’ and reveals hidden content. Upon clicking an open module, the circle containing an ‘x’ rotates back into a ‘+’ while hiding content.

In order to insert an accordion into an editable content area, a work order must be submitted to OPC. Once inserted, content for the accordion can be edited in a corresponding list. Any changes made to the list will reflect immediately on the live page.

#### Images

Images can be inserted into the editable content areas and must adhere to the guidelines for embedding images to ensure usability & accessibility. Images should be no wider than 250 pixels at 72dpi resolution. All images should also be optimized.

### Quick Links

Quick links is an optional page layout section that contains a scrollable group of linked cards. The cards scroll automatically (vertically on mobile & horizontally on desktop) as well as manually with use of swipe, click & drag or directional arrows. The links (and corresponding custom icons) are determined by a list that lives at the root of each site. Future enhancements to this module will enable auto-updating of links/icons based on dynamically-generated data of the popularity of pages within a site.

### Videos

There is an optional video module that can be enabled on all page layouts except the “Gallery” layout. The video module is located just above the resource link section & footer. To enable this module, 2 separate work orders must be submitted to the Office of Public Communications. First, an A/V work order must be submitted to upload a video to the Granicus server. Upon completion of first work order to upload the video, a second work order must be submitted requesting enabling of the video module on a web page.

### Resource Link Sections

All pages have an optional resource link section located just above the footer. The title (“Resources”) on this section cannot be changed. If empty/unused, this section will be automatically hidden. Resource link sections are responsive and when viewing on mobile devices will stack into a single full-width column.

## Layout-specific Elements

### Carousels

Carousels can contain images or videos and corresponding links. They must contain 3 items and are included in several page layouts. These modules can be edited directly in the page properties. Images must be 1200 pixels wide and adhere to image embedding guidelines.

### Article/Headline Link Sections

Article/Headline link sections can be edited directly on the page. If all fields are left empty, this module will collapse and be hidden from view on the published page. Article/Headline link sections are responsive and when viewing on mobile devices will stack into one easy-to-view column.

### Action Cards

These modules provide an simple yet efficient way to concisely communicate a call-to-action with accompaying action button. If all fields are left empty, this module will automatically collapse and be hidden from users on the page when published.

### Image Galleries

Image galleries have been optimized for the mobile web through usage of a masonry layout which automatically creates a layout that best fills a container based on an image’s dimensions. When a screen is resized or the page is viewed on a different device, the images reorganize into a pattern that makes the most usage of space available for easy viewing. Upon tapping/clicking an image, the image will open up in a lightbox which covers the fullscreen and provides information about each image (optional) as well as the ability to swipe/scroll through all images in the gallery without leaving the lightbox. These modules pull data dynamically from an image gallery list.
**Note:**
Portrait images (where the height is larger than the width) should be used in the masonry gallery only. The full-width, no-gutter gallery is reserved for groups of landscape (larger width than height) images only.

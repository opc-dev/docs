# Refined web color palette

Colors are a mainstay of the Broward County brand. In this update, the brand colors have been refined for the web with an understated boldness and contrast that meets or exceeds accessibility guidelines while maintaining delightful visual harmony. These colors are the only approved colors for use on Broward.org master pages & page layouts.

# Readable for type for as many users as possible

All potential color combinations of the refined color palette have been tested against Web A11Y Accessibility Standards. They have also been usability-tested with users who suffer from deutranopia, protanopia & tritanopia. These standards must be adhered to out of consideration for users with vision impairments.

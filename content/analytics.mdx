Web performance statistics can be used in understanding the effectiveness of a website. Broward County collects data and uses WebTrends software to provide Web analytics.
OPC reports performance measures for the Broward County internet website and for the BrowardEmployee.org intranet website monthly.

An agency may also request access to the WebTrends Reporting Center to report specific Web analytics for the agencyâ€™s website.

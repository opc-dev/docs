title: ETS & Third-Party Applications
---

All public facing applications, either developed by agency IT staff, ETS or provided through third party software, must include Broward County branding and adhere to Broward County website Policy and Standards. In addition, new and upgraded applications should maintain a common look and feel in keeping with the Broward County website. This includes implementing the application in responsive design where appropriate. Applications must be reviewed by OPC for compliance to the standards.

The County’s website structure, style and security must not be compromised by the integration of any third party web services. Approved third-party web services must link out
to the third party site. No code related to third party web services shall be embedded within County applications or websites. The County’s policies, standards and guidelines for branding, accessibility and usability must be adhered to when procuring approved third party applications. Approved third party web services must provide for record retention in adherence to Florida Record Retention and Public Records laws. It is prudent that OPC be involved as early in the process as possible to avoid delays and additional costs in providing the application. Exceptions to this policy must be reviewed by OPC.

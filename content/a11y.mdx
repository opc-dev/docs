title: Accessibility
---

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Title II, Chapter 5, mandates that state and local governments provide qualified individuals with disabilities equal access to their programs, services, or activities unless doing so would fundamentally alter the nature of their programs,
services or activities or would impose an undue burden.

In order to ensure that the County website(s) have accessible features for people with disabilities, Broward County Web Publishers should use the steps outlined in this document.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 provides a three-prong definition for the term “disability” with respect to an individual:

- a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual;
- a record of such an impairment; or
- being regarded as having such an impairment.

Individuals with disabilities, including but not limited to the traditional disabilities such as blindness, deafness and mobility impairments, are often faced with online barriers. Many individuals with disabilities use assistive technology that enables them to use computers. Specialized programs and/or devices, such as screen readers and text enlargement software, enable these individuals to use a computer.

While using assistive technology to access the web, they are confronted with unnecessary obstacles as a result of poorly designed websites. Problems often occur because web
contributors assume that everyone sees and accesses a web content in the same way. This assumption can frustrate assistive technology users.

Broward County’s commitment is to ensure that its website is in full compliance with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). As a result, all agencies must adhere to following standards and must take reasonable steps to design and develop websites that are accessible to people with disabilities as well as those without disabilities.

Broward County web designers, developers, and content providers must become familiar with the standards to achieve universal web usability and accessibility. This also includes contracted third party contributors. These standards must be applied when designing, creating, or revising any official County web page, document, presentation, eForm, eMagazine, eNewsletter, audio/video presentation, web application, and/or any other digital media/web equivalent.

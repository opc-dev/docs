Broward Web Publishing Approvers must preview the Web page during the approval process
**prior** to publishing the page.
During the preview, ensure the following:

- The master page template is correct.
- The page content area layout is appropriate.
- When reviewing the content “Think Mobile First.”
- The content is layed out in a logical way.
- The length of the page content is appropriate for ALL devices.
- The content provides enough “white” space for readability.
- Images are used sparingly.
- Images are low resolution.
- Images appear (i.e. not broken) and have “Alt” tags.
- Images do not exceed 250 pixels in width.
- Use thumbnails to link larger images (maximum size of large image is no more than 600 pixels.
- The information is up-to-date.
- The grammar is correct.
- There are no misspelled words.
- All content, including images, hyperlinks to pages/sites, hyperlinks to documents, etc. are reviewed. For example, if a hyperlink on the page opens a PDF document, the PDF is part of the approval process and needs to be reviewed.
- All links work and there are no “broken” links.
- Links to offsite content opens to a new window.
- Errors of any type, no matter how small, are resolved.
  Immediately after publishing the page to Broward.org, perform a second review since the
  preview may differ once published. Fix any errors immediately and publish the page again to
  Broward.org. Perform the review once to validate the changes made.

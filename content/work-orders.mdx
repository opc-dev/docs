Regardless of whether your agency has access or does not have access to publish content to the Broward County internet website and/or the BrowardEmployee.org intranet website, a work order can be submitted to OPC for web requests.

# How to Submit A Work Order

To submit a work order, go to BrowardEmployee.org Forms and select “Work Order” under the heading of Public Communications.

Once submitted and approved by the agency, the work order will be routed to an OPC manager for assignment. Along with providing a description of the work to be performed, agencies can also attach electronic document or image files to the work order which contain information relevant to the work order.

OPC provides website design services to all County agencies. Web services include content development, website design and management (including quality assurance) of the information for the County’s websites. Design services are free to general fund agencies. ETS is responsible for programming interactive applications, including those required for transactions and for the management of the infrastructure (servers and communication lines).

All requests for interactive, transactional type applications that involve databases, including the setup of an agency email address on a web page, should be directed to OPC who will manage the work request through ETS.

# Authorized Approvers

In order to submit a work order, agencies must appoint an authorized approver for internet or intranet work. The approver will receive an email and must approve the work order in order for OPC to begin work on the work request. Designers will not begin work until the work order has been approved by the designated approver. Once the authorizer has approved the work order then a designer who is assigned to the order will notify the contact listed on the order.

To designate or change an authorized approver, go to BrowardEmployee.org Forms and select “Authorized Signature Form for Requesting/Approving internet/Graphics Work” under the heading of “Public Communications.”

# Rush Jobs

If a request is urgent, submit a work order and immediately contact the OPC by phone. Please understand that every effort will be made to accommodate the requested date but the time required to complete the work and resources available may impact the actual completion date.

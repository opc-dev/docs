A common practice for embedding content on websites is through the use of iFrames. iFrames pull in content (often multimedia) from another web page and display it inside a frame. Since the content of the iFrame cannot be monitored, Broward.org does not use iFrames.

Video content can be included on a page using the optional video section.

All embedded content must be approved by OPC.

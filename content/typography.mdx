# Optimal readability

The majority of content on Broward.org is text-based therefore, using a typeface that works well for quick & easy reading on all devices is key to an improved website experience. The new Broward.org website uses the recently released ATC Arquette font family designed by Avondale Type Company. It has 8 weights and matching italics. It is a bold but neutral sans-serif designed for ease of legibility across all screen display sizes. For more information on ATC Arquette, visit avondaletypeco.com/fonts.

# A typographic system

A complete system of typographic styles based on web standards for readability & properlystructured HTML syntax has been implemented in this redesign. Selecting these styles is as simple as selecting a choice from a dropdown in Sharepoint.

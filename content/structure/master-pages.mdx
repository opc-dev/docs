title: Master Pages
---

The current version of Broward.org is built upon the Microsoft Sharepoint 2010 framework. Within this framework it is necessary that every page be assigned both a unique “master page” & “page layout.” In this redesign, we have reduced the number of master pages from over 800 existing in the previous version of the site down to one. This one master page contains header and footer elements. The header element contains navigation, search & accessibility options. The footer contains links to social media, comments and suggestions & terms of use. The master page can only be edited by OPC.

## Header

The header element spans across the top of each page. When scrolling through pages it remains ever-present, “stuck” to the top of the screen for easy access. Immediately visible on the header are the global navigation menu icon, Broward.org logo, search icon & accessibility icon. Each of these elements can be selected to reveal additional intuitive functionality.

### Navigation

Upon selecting the navigation menu (commonly referred to as a “hamburger” icon), a drawer slides in from the left. In this drawer, County-wide navigation is displayed. These links remain the same throughout all Broward.org sites providiing links to the top-level sites.

### Search

Upon selecting the search icon, a search bar drops down in which users can enter their search query. The Broward County public-facing website uses its own search appliance which is indexed nightly.

The best way to improve search results is to properly structure a site’s navigation and structure text content within each page following appropriate HTML syntax guidelines for hierarchy and accessibility. In addition to improving search results, this approach will ensure an improved experience for your users.

#### Search (Broward County Employee intranet websites)

The Broward County Employee intranet websites search engine, including “BrowardEmployee.org” and “BCPortal,” is provided by Microsoft Sharepoint. The search interface searches across all BrowardEmployee.org and BCPortal site collections. The search results can be managed by the site Administrator to ensure search results can be managed for audiences within an agency or across agencies.

### Accessibility Options

Upon selecting the accessibility options icon, three accessibility options will appear: increase text size, add contrast and translate.

By selecting to increase the text size (+A) , all text will be enlarged for easier readability. After selecting the increase text size (+A) option, the option will be changed to reduce text size (-A). Selecting the reduce text size (-A) option will result in reverting to the original setting.

By selecting the “add contrast” option, text will be made white and the background will become black. After selecting the “add contrast” option, the option will change to “remove contrast.” Selecting the option to “remove contrast” will result in reverting to the original setting. By selecting the “translate”, a dropdown with language options (Spanish, French, Creole & Portuguese) will appear and when a language is selected, text on the page will be dynamically translated to that language.

## Footer

The footer element spans the bottom of every Broward.org web page. It contains links to social
media, comments and suggestions & terms of use.

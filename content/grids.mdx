The layout for Broward.org has been created using the Bootstrap framework. Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework in the world for building responsive, mobile-first projects on the web. Bootstrap 4 is the latest release of this framework and many of the latest developments in this project have been incorporated into Broward.org to deliver cutting-edge user experience while accomodating for all the various devices and browsers at use.

Broward.org is based on Bootstrapâ€™s responsive 12-column grid for elements within a container of 1200 pixel max-width. Elements can also extend horizontally from edge-to-edge on the screen if necessary. Upon resizing of a browser window or viewing a page on a device of different screen size, the site dynamically adapts to deliver the best viewing experience for that particular screen.
